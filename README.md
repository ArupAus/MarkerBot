# Developer Installation Instructions

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt --trusted-host pypi.python.org
```

# Database Setup
Install [postgresql 9.6](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) if you don't already have it

Then create a DB for development/testing
```
$ psql -U postgres template1
# create database MarkerBot;
CREATE DATABASE
# \q
```
or use pgAdmin4 to create db via interface
you can switch which DB you interact with by changing between `APP_SETTINGS="config.DevelopmentConfig"` in your .env
you can configure the configs in config.py

To initialise DB run

`python manage.py db init`

and then use the following commands should you want to make changes to models.py and have them reflected in the DB

`python manage.py db migrate`

 then go the newly created file in  migrations/versions/autogeneratedmigration.py.
 
 Anywhere you see `astext_type=Text())` change it to `astext_type=sa.Text())`

 (dont know why alembic doesn't do this for you...)

and then you can run..
`python manage.py db upgrade`
you should now have a DB with the latest schema

## run DB setup

run this script to update question set in DB
```
$ python -m util.runDBSetup
```
